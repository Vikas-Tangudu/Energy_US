# Energy_US
This is a data wrangling project.

Department of Energy, USA is looking for full-scale data solutions that  will help them in
understanding consumptions patterns,
energy demand forecasts,
predictive maintenance and Many more
They are looking for contractors who can help them in building these data solutions and pipelines, but to start with they are looking for a POC that demonstrates effective data storage and interactive data analysis capabilities.

It is your responsibility as a data engineer to achieve the following tasks:
Finding the right storage solution for accommodating larger datasets
Interactive way of analysis for ad-hoc reports that goes well with Storage Solution
Finding a way to script out some of the common data analysis tasks

Goal -1 :
1. Identify the storage system which you would like to use as a part of POC
2. Ensure you increase the availability of data in data storage
3. Data stored should be accessible to write scripts and create interactive queries for ad-hoc requests


Goal - 2 :
Create a query that gives you the monthly consumption of all the buildings in "USA_AL_Anniston.Metro.AP.722287_TMY3"


Goal - 3 :
Create a data frame will all files across all folders.
Add a column that contains the filename to this data frame.
Find and remove any duplicate rows available in the dataset
Get column-wise null records for the data frame
Partition of the resultant data frame by month
Get the number of rows from each partition


Also I only have bare minimum knowledge about Spark while working on this, so it also acts as a Level-0 in spark. This helps me know how much I have grown into spark optimizations in future.
